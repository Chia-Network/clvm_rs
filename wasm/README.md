The `clvm_rs` package has JavaScript bindings for the rust implementation of clvm in wasm.

This project is very immature, and only some test API is available for the moment. Pull requests are welcome.


Build

Use `wasm-pack` to build the wasm `pkg` file used with npm. Install it with:

```

Then build with

```
